# Legacy Runtime Parking

All Node/Express/tRPC, Prisma, scraping, Playwright, and experimental AI tooling has been moved into this directory to keep the new standalone PHP + static frontend deployment clean. Nothing has been deleted; the previous stack can be restored by moving these folders back out of `legacy/` if needed.
